Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a consulting company that works with companies to determine what the best financial plan for them is. Their software requirements were largely based around secure communication between them and the client. The issue that they wanted me to address was the lack of security measures put in place. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  The research and implementation of the cipher/checksum verification was done well. Secure code is incredibly important as it is the first defense against cyber attacks and can mitigate preventable problems such as data leaks. Software security makes a company more reliable, protected, and often times even more efficient.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The most challenging personal aspect was the testing as partway through the term I faced an using getting Maven to run. Otherwise the rest was relatively understandable.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  The layers of security were increased by adding a variety of different security measures at the different stages. In the future, I would like to use Maven (granted I can get it to work properly) as well as discuss the safety standards of wherever I end up working at. I ran the code to assure that it was function, and checked to make sure that the browser was secure, and the checksum verification was successful. In terms of testing, I was unfortunately unable to do so using Maven. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  The knowledge of how to use ciphers is something that I would imagine will be valuable in many assignments to come as much of software development involves data encryption. 
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  From this assignment I might show employers the successful generation of the checksum in the web browser, as well as the certificate generation.
